    <h2>
        As our world becomes more digitally connected, children around the world have started to connect through the cyberspace.
        With the COVID-19 pandemic, children have started started to rely on online communication to connect with their peers.
        With more children communicating online everyday it is important that they understand the consiquences of cyber Bullying
        and that when communicating online, misinterpretations of texts and emails can result in accidental cyber bullying. For 
        this reason we created stopcyberbullying.com to educate students and give them resources to check their messages BEFORE they
        are sent.
