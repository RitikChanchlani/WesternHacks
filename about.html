        Who Are We?
    </h3>
    <p class="aboutustext">
        We are a team of four post-secondary computer science students passionate about making a difference in the world.
        As technology becomes more and more advanced, our society has become as interconnected online as ever, especially in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        Growing up, we've all been taught the dangers of bullying, and how these risks have become even more prevalent online.
        With this in mind, our team decided to create a tool and scans text, protecting not only children, but members of society in general.
        On our team, we believe in the motto: "treat others the way you would like to be treated".
        For this reason, our unique algorithm analyzes text, either from user-input or from a website URL given by the user, and reminds the user of any possible negative interpretations of their messages before they may unintentionally spread hate around the world.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutustext">Our primary objective is to help encourage more positive language and communication, to make our world a better and happier place. Join us in accomplishing our mission!</p>
